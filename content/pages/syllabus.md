Course Description
------------------

This course features a core framework for an interest-based, problem-solving approach to technology, logistics and other systems-oriented negotiations. A comprehensive approach to dispute resolution in organizations and complex engineered systems is also developed. The course builds key interactive skills, including communications skills, dealing with difficult people, negotiating over the "rules of game," and cross-cultural negotiations. Assignments center on analysis of negotiated interactions and assessing dispute resolution systems.

This course provides an alternate presentation of the materials presented in the two course sequence Technology Policy Organizations ([ESD.932](/courses/esd-932-technology-policy-organizations-spring-2005)) and Technology Policy Negotiations and Dispute Resolution ([ESD.933](/courses/esd-933-technology-policy-negotiations-and-dispute-resolution-spring-2005)).
